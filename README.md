# STM32Projects
This respository is used to save my STM32 Pojects using STM32CubeIDE+STM32CubeMX application or ARM-keil.
All the projects is using HAL libary in Cortex-M3/M4 MCU.
FAQ: What can I find in this STM32Projects respositary?
You can believe that all the projects were verified in specific projects,so that's means all the code can use for your STM32 projects derectly or just 
modify some parameters.
If you have more efficiency and better code ,you can push your code in this lib.Thank you!
